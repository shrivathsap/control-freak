# control-freak

Well, this one time I thought I was abusing chrome (browser) and miktex (for latexing stuff) and I thought I needed to control my activities and this was born. Requires windoes, runs in the background and logs how long you use the program etc. One can add whichever process one wants, by finding the name of the process with some command like getprocs

Ultimately ths thing was useless because, to reduce cpu/memory usage, the thing scans which process are running every 5 minutes (i think). So, there's your loophole, just take a 5 minute break every now and then, and you can prevent all kinds of warnings popping up every hour.

Also I think I restricted the program to have a regular 9 to 5 job (it was 9 to 9 perhaps, because the economy is doing its thing)
